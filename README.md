# C# DivideByZeroException Example

This repository demonstrates a simple C# program that throws a `DivideByZeroException`.  The example shows how easy it is to unintentionally cause this error and how to prevent it.

## Bug

The `bug.cs` file contains code that attempts to divide an integer by zero. This will result in a runtime exception, halting the program's execution.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.cs` file demonstrates a corrected version of the code. It includes input validation to prevent division by zero. This demonstrates a robust way to handle potential exceptions and prevents program crashes.
